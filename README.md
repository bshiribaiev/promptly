## 💡 Inspiration
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools — but they’re only as good as the prompts they receive.  
Many users struggle to write effective prompts, leading to vague or irrelevant responses. Others simply don’t know *how* to prompt efficiently or are too busy to fine-tune their queries.

We wanted to make this process simple, accessible, and impactful.  
**[Prodcut Name]** was born to help users generate better, clearer, and more effective prompts — improving response quality *and* reducing unnecessary compute usage (which means a smaller carbon footprint).

## 🚀 What It Does
[Prodcut Name] helps users turn vague ideas into powerful, structured prompts.  

**Key Features:**
- 🧠 **Prompt Refinement:** Takes an initial rough prompt and enhances it using prompt engineering best practices.  
- 💬 **Guided Prompt Builder:** Interactive UI that helps users describe what they want step-by-step.  
- 🎯 **AI-Powered Optimization:** Uses an LLM to evaluate and improve prompts for clarity, specificity, and tone.  
- 🌍 **Sustainability Impact:** Reduces token usage and compute cost by helping users get better answers *the first time*.
