## 💡 Inspiration
Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful tools — but they’re only as good as the prompts they receive. Many users struggle to write effective prompts, leading to vague or irrelevant responses. Others simply don’t know *how* to prompt efficiently or are too busy to fine-tune their queries. We wanted to make this process simple, accessible, and impactful.  

**Promptly** was created to help users generate better, clearer, and more effective prompts — improving response quality *and* reducing unnecessary compute usage (which means a smaller carbon footprint).

---

## 🧭 Why It’s Important

- 💬 **Bridges the Gap Between Users and AI:** Most users don’t know how to communicate effectively with LLMs. Promptly empowers everyone — not just tech experts — to get high-quality results.

- 🧠 **Improves Output Quality:** Well-structured prompts lead to more accurate, relevant, and creative AI responses — saving users time and frustration.

- 🌱 **Reduces Computational Footprint:** Every misfired or repeated query to an LLM consumes energy and tokens. By helping users get it right the first time, Promptly promotes *sustainable AI usage*.

- ⚙️ **Saves Time and Resources:** Reduces the need for trial-and-error prompting, cutting down on API costs and unnecessary iterations.

- 🌍 **Universal Use Cases:** From students and content creators to developers and businesses — anyone using AI tools benefits from smarter prompts.

- 💡 **Scalable Impact:** As AI usage grows, tools that optimize how we interact with LLMs will play a key role in responsible and efficient AI adoption.

## 🚀 What It Does
Promptly helps users turn vague ideas into powerful, structured prompts.  

**Key Features:**
- 🧠 **Prompt Refinement:** Takes an initial rough prompt and enhances it using prompt engineering best practices.  
- 💬 **Guided Prompt Builder:** Interactive UI that helps users describe what they want step-by-step.  
- 🎯 **AI-Powered Optimization:** Uses an LLM to evaluate and improve prompts for clarity, specificity, and tone.  
- 🌍 **Sustainability Impact:** Reduces token usage and compute cost by helping users get better answers *the first time*.

## 🧠 How We Built It

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (React, TypeScript) with TailwindCSS and Radix UI for modern, responsive components
- **Backend:** Node.js server to handle API requests and connect the frontend with external services
- **Database:** None required for the MVP; expandable to Firebase or MongoDB for saving prompts and user data
- **APIs / Integrations:** Google AI Studio (Gemini) for AI-powered prompt optimization, ElevenLabs API for text-to-speech
- **Other Tools:** GitHub (version control), Figma (design and prototyping)

## Challenges We Ran Into
- Figuring out ElevenLabs WebSocket integration
- Connecting backend and frontend smoothly
- Setting up and configuring the frontend environment with new tools
---

## Accomplishments
- ✅ **First-Try Results** — Guides users to create strong prompts the first time → no endless tweaking
- 🌍 **Lower Environmental Cost** — Fewer retries = less compute = smaller carbon footprint
- 🧑‍🏫 **No Prompt Engineering Needed** — Anyone can master AI without specialized training
- 🎯 **Better Outcomes** — Context-aware prompts that deliver accurate, goal-aligned results
---

## What We Learned
- How to integrate and troubleshoot **unfamiliar APIs**
- How to work with AI beyond Python — this time experimenting in **Java and JavaScript/TypeScript**
- Debugging and problem-solving with tools and frameworks we hadn’t used before

## What's Next
Future Plans for Promptly:
- 🤖 **AI Agent Integration**: Connect Promptly to Slack, Gmail, and other workflows for real-time, context-aware prompting
- 💻 **VS Code Extension**: Help developers optimize coding prompts directly in their IDE
- 🌐 **Browser Extension**: Bring Promptly into everyday browsing for instant context-building
