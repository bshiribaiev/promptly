# ðŸ”´ CRITICAL FIX - RESTART BACKEND NOW

## The Root Cause Found!

The WebSocket was emitting "ready" **BEFORE** the output flux was subscribed to.
In reactive programming, you can't emit to a stream before someone is listening!

## The Fix Applied

Changed line 48-53 to use `.doOnSubscribe()` so "ready" is sent AFTER subscription.

## YOU MUST RESTART THE BACKEND

The backend process is still running OLD code from 8:19 PM.

### Steps:

1. **Find the terminal running `./gradlew bootRun`**
2. **Press Ctrl+C** to stop it
3. **Restart with**:

```bash
cd "/Users/shiribaiev/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-bekbolnyc@gmail.com/My Drive/hack-knights/backend"
export STT_PROVIDER=elevenlabs
export ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_actual_key_here
./gradlew bootRun
```

4. **Test the frontend** - Voice Input should now work!

## Expected Behavior After Restart:

- Browser console: "WebSocket connected"
- Browser console: "WebSocket ready to receive audio"
- Backend logs: "WebSocket connection established"
- Backend logs: "Output flux subscribed, sending ready message"
- After speaking + stop: transcript appears

## Why This Fix Works:

Reactive streams need subscribers before emitting. We moved the "ready" emit into `.doOnSubscribe()` callback which fires when `session.send(output)` starts consuming the flux.
